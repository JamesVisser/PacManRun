This project is called pacman run.

The program displays a pac screen image as a background and contains a several pacman images used to open and close the mouth and reverse Pacman. A radius was also used to create an object in the shape of a transparent ghost. The two objects move through the screen with udifferent methods of code. The Pacman uses left and right directioning while the ghost is on an x and y axis.

The usage is a basic visualization to demonstrate coding abilities.
